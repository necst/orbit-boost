## Description of archive
The archive is structured as follows:
```    
├─ hardware/           # Host application
|  └─ native/          # C host code
|  └─ python/          # python host code + testbench
└─ IP/                 # everything needed to generate the .bit and .hwh files
|  └─ Vitis HLS/       # C++ code to generate the package
|  └─ Vivado/Package/  # Package to generate .bit and .hwh files
```
 
## Instructions to build and test project

### Step 1 - Clone the repository
Open a terminal, then clone the repository by running the following command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/necst/guido-fpga.git
```
Then, move into the repository with 
```shell
cd guido-fpga
```

### Step 2 - Generate the .bit and .hwh files
Open Vitis HLS 2024.1 and use the code in the /IP/Vitis HLS/ to generate the package by running the **Package**.

The same output file generated by the **Package** run is already available in the /IP/Vivado/ folder

Then open VIvado 2024.1, import the IP code present in the previously generated Package and generate the `.bit` and `.hwh` files by running the **Generate Bitstream**.

The bitstream files generated are already available in the /hardware/python/bitstream/ folder

### Step 3 - Connect to the Kria KD240
Carefully connect the Kria KD240 and after setting it up, be 
```shell
cd /hardware/python
```


Run
